## Notes for Question Selection

When selecting questions for the active questionnaire:

1. **Balance categories** - Aim for roughly equal distribution across social/lifestyle/opinions
2. **Maximize divisiveness** - Best questions split people ~50/50, not 90/10
3. **Avoid dated references** - Skip questions tied to specific apps/trends that may not last
4. **Keep NYC-specific questions limited** - Too many excludes non-NYC users if you expand
5. **Test for response variance** - If everyone answers the same, the question isn't useful for matching
